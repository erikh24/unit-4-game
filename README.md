Project Title:
Crystal Collector!

Prerequisites:
This is a game that runs in the browser so there is no need to install any special software to play it.


Goal for the player:
The point of the game is to try and match your score to the target score by clicking on the crystals which each have a random point value assigned.


Directions:
There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal, you will add a specific amount of points to your
total score.
You win the game by matching your score to the target score. You lose the game if your score
goes above the target score.
The value of each crystal is hidden from you. Once you click a crystal, you can figure out the value of
it by comparing your new score to your old score.
Each time you start a new game, the values of the crystals will change.


Built With:
Visual Studio Code
